# Autogiftr

This tutorial will help you build the Autogiftr app.

### Step 1.

Make sure your command line is using the correct RVM.

`rails -v` will tell you if you are using the right version. If it says that Rails is not installed, then enter the RVM command:

```
rvm use ruby-2.0.0-p247@rails4
```

### Step 2. 

Go to the [Rails Composer](http://railsapps.github.io/rails-composer/) app to copy the url you will need to create the app.

Open your command line/terminal, go to your apps folder and create the new app

```
rails new autogiftr -m https://raw.github.com/RailsApps/rails-composer/master/composer.rb
```
